relationship with us (for example, pursuant to a contract) has been terminated or altered in
any way, for a reasonable period thereafter (including, where applicable, a period to enable
us to enforce our rights under any contract with you).</p></li>
<h2>WITHDRAWING YOUR CONSENT</h2>
<li><p>The consent that you provide for the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data will
remain valid until such time it is being withdrawn by you in writing. You may withdraw consent
and request us to stop using and/or disclosing your personal data for any or all of the purposes
listed above by submitting your request in writing or via email to our Data Protection Officer
at the contact details provided below.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon receipt of your written request to withdraw your consent, we may require reasonable
time (depending on the complexity of the request and its impact on our relationship with you)
for your request to be processed and for us to notify you of the consequences of us acceding
to the same, including any legal consequences which may affect your rights and liabilities to
us. In general, we shall seek to process your request within ten (10) business days of receiving
it.</p></li>
<li><p>Whilst we respect your decision to withdraw your consent, please note that depending on the
nature and scope of your request, we may not be in a position to continue providing our goods 
or services to you and we shall, in such circumstances, notify you before completing the
processing of your request. Should you decide to cancel your withdrawal of consent, please
inform us in writing in the manner described in clause 8 above.</p></li>
<li><p>Please note that withdrawing consent does not affect our right to continue to collect, use and
disclose personal data where such collection, use and disclose without consent is permitted
or required under applicable laws.</p></li>
<h2>ACCESS TO AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<li><p>If you wish to make (a) an access request for access to a copy of the personal data which we
hold about you or information about the ways in which we use or disclose your personal data,
or (b) a correction request to correct or update any of your personal data which we hold about
you, you may submit your request in writing or via email to our Data Protection Officer at the
contact details provided below.</p></li>
<li><p>Please note that a reasonable fee may be charged for an access request. If so, we will inform
you of the fee before processing your request.</p></li>
<li><p>We will respond to your request as soon as reasonably possible. Should we not be able to
respond to your request within thirty (30) days after receiving your request, we will inform
you in writing within thirty (30) days of the time by which we will be able to respond to your
request. If we are unable to provide you with any personal data or to make a correction
requested by you, we shall generally inform you of the reasons why we are unable to do so
(except where we are not required to do so under the PDPA).</p></li>
<h2>PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<li><p>To safeguard your personal data from unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying,
modification, disposal or similar risks, we have introduced appropriate administrative,
physical and technical measures such as up-to-date antivirus protection, encryption and the
use of privacy filters to secure all storage and transmission of personal data by us, and
disclosing personal data both internally and to our authorised third party service providers
and agents only on a need-to-know basis.</p></li>
<li><p>You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method
of electronic storage is completely secure. While security cannot be guaranteed, we strive to
protect the security of your information and are constantly reviewing and enhancing our
information security measures.</p></li>
<h2>ACCURACY OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<li><p>We generally rely on personal data provided by you (or your authorised representative). In
order to ensure that your personal data is current, complete and accurate, please update us
if there are changes to your personal data by informing our Data Protection Officer in writing
or via email at the contact details provided below.</p></li>
<h2>RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA</h2>
<li><p>We may retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which
it was collected, or as required or permitted by applicable laws.</p></li>
<li><p>We will cease to retain your personal data, or remove the means by which the data can be
associated with you, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that such retention no longer serves
the purpose for which the personal data was collected, and is no longer necessary for legal or
business purposes.</p></li>
<h2>TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE OF SINGAPORE</h2>
<li><p>We generally do not transfer your personal data to countries outside of Singapore. However,
if we do so, we will obtain your consent for the transfer to be made and we will take steps to
ensure that your personal data continues to receive a standard of protection that is at least
comparable to that provided under the PDPA.</p></li>
